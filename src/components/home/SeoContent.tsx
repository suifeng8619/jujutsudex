                                In <strong>Jujutsu Infinite</strong>, your Innate Technique defines your playstyle. From the immense power of the <em>Limitless (Gojo)</em> to the shadowy depths of <em>Ten Shadows (Megumi)</em>, each technique brings unique movesets. Rerolling for high-tier techniques (0.1% chance) is a core part of the game loop. Our tier list breaks down the DPS and utility of every technique, helping you decide whether to keep or spin.

                                Your lineage matters. Joining a prestigious <strong>Jujutsu Infinite Clan</strong> like the Gojo or Kamo clan grants passive stat buffs that can turn the tide of battle. Combine this with powerful Traits like <em>Heavenly Restriction</em> or <em>Six Eyes</em> to create a truly broken build. Our database lists every clan buff and trait drop rate so you can plan your ideal character.

                                    While techniques are flashy, raw martial arts are reliable. <strong>Black Flash</strong> is considered the peak of striking power, offering critical damage multipliers. For weapon users, mastering the <strong>Inverted Spear of Heaven</strong> provides a vital counter to domain expansions.
